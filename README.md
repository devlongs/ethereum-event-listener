# Ethereum Event Listener API

The Ethereum Event Listener API is a powerful tool that allows you to monitor and capture events emitted by Ethereum smart contracts. With this API, you can easily register event listeners for specific contracts and event names, and retrieve the captured event data for further analysis or integration with other systems.

## Features

- Register event listeners for Ethereum smart contracts
- Capture and store emitted events in a MySQL database
- Retrieve event data through RESTful API endpoints
- Authenticate API requests using API keys
- Dockerized application for easy deployment and scalability

## Technologies Used

- Golang
- Gin Web Framework
- Ethereum Go Client (go-ethereum)
- GORM (Go ORM for MySQL)
- MySQL Database
- Docker
- Docker Compose
